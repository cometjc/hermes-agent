"""Regression tests for ACTIVE_SESSION_BYPASS_COMMANDS.

Bug (root cause)
----------------
When an agent is actively running on a gateway platform (e.g. Telegram), the
adapter-layer dispatch in ``gateway/platforms/base.py`` checks
``should_bypass_active_session(cmd)`` BEFORE any of the per-command logic in
``gateway/run.py`` runs.  If the command is not in the bypass allowlist, the
adapter hands the message to ``_busy_session_handler`` which calls
``running_agent.interrupt(event.text)`` and replies with the
``⚡ Interrupting current task...`` ack.  The command text never reaches its
handler and is instead delivered to the agent as interrupt text.

Symptom
-------
Sending ``/model`` (or ``/verbose``, ``/fast``, ``/reasoning``, ``/yolo``,
``/personality``, ``/provider``, ``/voice``) while the agent is running on
Telegram produces ``⚡ Interrupting current task...`` instead of executing the
settings command.

Fix
---
These commands only touch config / are read-only — they never mutate the
running agent's state.  They are therefore safe to dispatch while an agent is
running and must be included in
``hermes_cli.commands.ACTIVE_SESSION_BYPASS_COMMANDS``.

See also: ``gateway/platforms/base.py:1617`` — the adapter-layer bypass check
that this allowlist drives.
